# haricot

Haricot is (so far) a Haskell implementation of a parser and a pretty-printer for the [beancount](https://furius.ca/beancouont) plain text accounting format.

## Text-based accounting?

[Read this](http://plaintextaccounting.org/).

## Why beancount?

Compared to [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org) and [hledger](https://www.hledger.org), I like the file format better. Also, it has extremely nice support for creating custom importers for various file formats. It is full-featured with CLI and web-based tools, and serves my purpose really well.

## Why create another implementation?

For the fun of it! I love Haskell, I love beancount, and I love writing tools.
