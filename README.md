# Haricot

Haricot is a [plain text accounting](http://plaintextaccounting.org/) tool in the tradition of [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org), [beancount](https://furius.ca/beancount) and others. Distinctive features and objectives:

* Clean implementation in Haskell
* Aim for the best abstractions
* Natively support multi-asset and multi-currency 
* Hopelessly incomplete compared to others

Accounting with Haricot is based on text files, and adopts a subset of the beancount syntax, which I found the easiest to parse.

## Project ideas

* Use QuickCheck for testing
* Create a complete journal for test data
* Write a ncurses-like tool for analysis
* Command line options
* Good pretty-printing
